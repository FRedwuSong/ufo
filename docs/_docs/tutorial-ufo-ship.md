## Step 3 - Ship the Code to ECS

In this guide we have walked through what ufo does step by step.  First ufo builds the Docker image with `ufo docker build`.  Then it will build and register the ECS task definitions with the `ufo tasks` commands. Now we'll deploy the code to ECS.

```sh
ufo ship hi-web
```

By convention, ufo will ship the docker container to an ECS cluster with the same value as UFO_ENV, which defaults to development.  So the command above is the same as:

```sh
ufo ship hi-web --cluster production
UFO_ENV=production ufo ship hi-web --cluster prod
```

When you run `ufo ship hi-web`:

1. It builds the docker image.
2. Generates a task definition and registers it.
3. Updates the ECS service to use it.

If the ECS service hi-web does not yet exist, ufo will create the service for you. Ufo will also automatically create the ECS cluster.

NOTE: If you are relying on this tool to create the cluster, you still need to associate ECS Container Instances to the cluster yourself.

By convention, if the service has a container name web, you'll get prompted to create an ELB and specify a target group ARN.  The ELB and target group must already exist. You can bypass the prompt and specify the target group ARN as part of the ship command or with the `--no-target-group-prompt` option.  The ELB target group only gets associated with the ECS service if the service is being created for the first time.  If the service already exists then the `--target-group` parameter just gets ignored and the ECS task simply gets updated.  Example:


```bash
ufo ship hi-web --target-group=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:12345689:targetgroup/hi-web/12345
```

Let's go back to the original command and take a look at the output:

```sh
ufo ship hi-web
```

The output should look something like this (some of the output has been removed for conciseness):

```sh
$ ufo ship hi-web
Building docker image with:
  docker build -t tongueroo/hi:ufo-2017-06-12T06-46-12-a18aa30 -f Dockerfile .

```

Checking the ECS console you should see something like this:

You have successfully shipped a docker image to ECS! üçæü•Ç

## Skipping Previous Steps Method

You should notice that `ufo ship` re-built the docker image and re-registered the task definitions.  The `ufo ship` command is designed to run everything in one simple command, so we do not have to manually call the commands in the previous pages: `ufo build` and `ufo tasks`.

If you would like to skip the first 2 steps, then you can use the [ufo deploy]({% link _reference/ufo-deploy.md %}) instead.  The `ufo deploy` command will:

1. register the task definition in `.ufo/output/hi-web.json` unmodified
2. update the ECS service

Example:

```sh
ufo deploy hi-web
```

The output should look something like this:

```sh
Shipping hi-web...
hi-web service updated on stag cluster with task hi-web
Software shipped!
```

Normally you run everything together in one `ufo ship` command though.  Ufo takes a multiple step process and simplifies it down to a single command!

Congratulations üéä You have successfully built a Docker image, register it and deployed it to AWS ECS.
