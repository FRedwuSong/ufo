title: ufo help
---

You can run help for quick help information right at the cli.  Example:

```sh
ufo help
```

You can append `help`, `-h` or `--help` to the end of any command to get more help information about that specific command.  These all work.

```sh
ufo docker build help
ufo ship --help
ufo ships -h
```
