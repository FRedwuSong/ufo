title: Quick Start
---

In a hurry? No sweat! Here's a quick start to using ufo that takes only a few minutes. For this example, we will use a sinatra app from [tongueroo/hi](https://github.com/tongueroo/ufo).  The first `ufo init` command sets up the ufo directory structure in your project. The second `ufo ship` command deploys your code to an AWS ECS service.

```sh
brew cask install boltopslabs/software/bolts
git clone https:///github.com/tongueroo/hi.git
cd hi
ufo init --app=hi --env stag --cluster=stag --image=tongueroo/hi
ufo ship hi-web-stag
```

You should see something similar to this:

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed code to AWS ECS with ufo. It was really that simple üòÅ

Note: This quick start does require that you have a docker working on your environment.  For docker installation instructions refer to to the official [docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
