                    <p>Ufo is a tool that makes building and shipping Docker containers to AWS ECS super easy. At a basic level, ufo builds the docker container image, registers that image to ECS as a task definition, and then deploys that task definition to ECS by updating the service. Ufo provides a `ufo ship` command that deploys your code to ECS.</p>

                    <p>Ufo was built directly from real life production use cases after seeing the same patterns repeated over and over. Ufo allows you to write the AWS task definition json format file in ERB, an easy templating language.  This allows you to reuse the ufo tool with multiple applications and only put the truly application specific business logic in each app code base.</p>
